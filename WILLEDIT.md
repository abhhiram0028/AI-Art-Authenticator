The AI Art Authenticator: Deep Learning Image Classification project leverages deep learning techniques to tackle the challenging task of
distinguishing between Images that are produced using artificial intelligence and those that are not. With a comprehensive dataset consisting of
6000 Images that are produced using artificial intelligence and those made by humans for training, and an additional 3000 images in each category
for testing, this project achieves an accuracy rate of 87.95%. A CNN architecture was developed for the project's core component utilising
TensorFlow and Keras. This CNN has layers that include convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, and its final layer uses sigmoid
activation for binary classification. When training the model, enhanced picture data is utilised to increase the model's robustness and
generalizability.
